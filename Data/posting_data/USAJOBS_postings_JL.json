Recruitment Bonus - $5,000 will be provided at the time of appointment, with another $5,000 provided following completion of 18 months of service. Provision of these payments requires the execution of a two-year service agreement with the department. Sick Leave - Employees earn 104 hours of sick leave per year that accrues without limit. Sick leave not utilized at the time of retirement will be added to the annuitant's length of service when calculating their retirement benefit. Annual Leave - Employees earn annual leave at the following rates: 13 days per year for the first three years of service, 20 days after three years of service, and 26 days every year after 15 years of service. Employees may carry over a maximum of 240 hours (30 days) of annual leave from one calendar year to the next; Overtime - Supreme Court Police Officers working overtime are eligible to earn monetary pay or compensatory time at a rate of 1.5 times their derived hourly pay; Premium Pay - Supreme Court Police Officers working the hours between 6:00 PM and 6:00 AM are eligible to earn Night Differential at a rate of 10% of their derived hourly pay. Sunday premium is earned at a rate of 25% of their derived hourly pay; Paid Parental Leave - The Court provides up to 12 administrative workweeks of paid parental leave during the 12-month period following the birth or new placement of a child; Retirement - The Federal Law Enforcement Retirement System offered by the Supreme Court of the United States is a special variant of the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) offered to most U.S. government employees.

Police annuitants receive 1.7% of their high-3 for the first 20 years of their service, and 1% for each additional year. This translates to 34% of the high-3 for police officers retiring after 20 years of service, and 39% if retiring after 25 years. The second part is the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), which is a defined-contribution pension (savings account). Employees may contribute up to the IRS maximum, and the Court will match any contributions up to 5% of base salary; The third part of the FERS benefit is access to social security. As Supreme Court Police Officers are able (and required) to retire before they are eligible to apply for social security, a FERS supplement is paid to compensate until age 62; Employees with prior military service may buy back their active duty military time to be added to their length of service for the purposes of the annuity calculation. Military time cannot, however, be added to the length of service for determining retirement eligibility; Educational Assistance - Up to $5,000 per calendar year is available based on budget approval and the relevance of the requested courses to enhance job performance.

Sick Leave - Employees earn 104 hours of sick leave per year that accrues without limit. Sick leave not utilized at the time of retirement will be added to the annuitant's length of service when calculating their retirement benefit. Annual Leave - Employees earn annual leave at the following rates: 13 days per year for the first three years of service, 20 days after three years of service, and 26 days every year after 15 years of service. Employees may carry over a maximum of 240 hours (30 days) of annual leave from one calendar year to the next; Overtime - Supreme Court Police Officers working overtime are eligible to earn monetary pay or compensatory time at a rate of 1.5 times their derived hourly pay; Premium Pay - Supreme Court Police Officers working the hours between 6:00 PM and 6:00 AM are eligible to earn Night Differential at a rate of 10% of their derived hourly pay.

Employees may contribute up to the IRS maximum, and the Court will match any contributions up to 5% of base salary; The third part of the FERS benefit is access to social security. As Supreme Court Police Officers are able (and required) to retire before they are eligible to apply for social security, a FERS supplement is paid to compensate until age 62; Employees with prior military service may buy back their active duty military time to be added to their length of service for the purposes of the annuity calculation.
