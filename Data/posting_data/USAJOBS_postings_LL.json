Age Requirements \u2013 Sworn officer positions with the USCP are subject to the mandatory retirement provisions of the Capitol Police Retirement Act, which requires an officer to separate/retire from the USCP by age 57, but as the result of current critical mission requirement, the age has been increased to 59. Applicants must be at least 21 years old at time of appointment and ordinarily not older than 37. However, the maximum entry age has been increased to 39 years of age at the time of appointment (or 40 years of age if the individual turns 40 in the same month of their initial appointment), with required mandatory retirement after 20 years of Federal law enforcement service (e.g., employed at 39 years of age and retire at 59 years of age).
